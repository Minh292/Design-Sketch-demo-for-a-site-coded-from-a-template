# Design-Sketch-demo-for-a-site-coded-from-a-template
This assignment requires that you create an image in which you show (and describe) the sketches you have created for you site. You will pay special attention to demonstrate that you have at least two unique views - one of which should be a mobile view.

Upload an image that shows the design sketches you have created for your site. 

Each site should have at least two views (mobile and larger screen). 

If you plan on having a landing page (a unique page that has a different layout than the others), make sure to include a sketch of that as well. 

Remember, good wireframes should not utilize color, font etc. but it is okay to include content.

Please include a brief write-up.
